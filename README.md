# thinkfast

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# 📱 Internship Task 2 – App Development Assignment

## 🎯 Objective

Each intern will develop a mobile application using Java (Android), Kotlin (Android), or Flutter (cross-platform). You may choose any one of these technologies based on your comfort level.

The purpose of this task is to evaluate your coding, problem-solving, UI design, and ability to complete a project end-to-end.

🔧 Requirements

## App Concept

The app should be unique (not just a basic calculator or to-do list).

It should be moderately challenging – not too complex but also not too trivial.

Examples of acceptable app ideas:

Expense Tracker App (track daily expenses, categorize them, show summary)

Habit Tracker App (track daily habits with streaks)

Notes App with Categories (create, edit, delete, search notes)

Quiz App (multiple-choice quiz with score calculation)

Weather App (fetch weather data using any free API)

Recipe App (store and browse recipes with images)

Book/Movies Collection App (add, edit, mark favorite, and search items)

💡 Tip: You may choose any other app idea, but it should have a useful purpose, at least 2–3 screens, and some interactive features.

## Technical Requirements

Must be built using Java, Kotlin, or Flutter (choose one).

Should have at least 3–4 screens/pages. Example: Home, Details, Add Item, Settings.

Must include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Must include data persistence (store data using local database like SQLite/Room/SharedPreferences in Java/Kotlin or SQFlite/Shared Preferences in Flutter).

UI should be simple but neat (no need for professional design, but it must be user-friendly).

Optional but encouraged: API integration (if you use an external API like weather/news, bonus points).

Submission Requirements

Screenshots of each screen of the app (to demonstrate UI & functionality).

Source code (Share via GitHub).

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

Functionality – Does the app work as expected?

Code Quality – Is the code clean, readable, and structured?

UI/UX – Is the design simple, usable, and error-free?

Creativity – Is the idea unique and practical?

Completeness – Are screenshots + code provided?

## 📌 Notes

You can either work individually on your app or make a little group of 2-5 for one app.

If you face technical issues, you may search online (StackOverflow, docs, etc.), but the final work must be your own.

Choose an app idea that fits within your skill level – don’t make it overcomplicated.

## 👉 Deliverables:
App screenshots (all screens)
Source code (zipped / GitHub repo)

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# 📌Further improvements needed:
 ### Removal of google auth system completely
    - google auth needed premium support in order to work 
    - setup is done till this point just need premium in order to work

### new auth verification system
